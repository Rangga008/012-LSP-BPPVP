# TODO: Enhance Register and Login UI to Match Index Page Style

## Steps to Complete

- [x] Update Landing/css/auth.css with modern styles matching index.php (gradients, shadows, hover effects, consistent colors and fonts)
- [x] Test the updated register.php and login.php pages for visual consistency and responsiveness
- [x] Verify login functionality: database connection, password verification, session handling
- [x] Verify register functionality: password hashing, database insertion, redirection

## Notes

- Focus on visual enhancements: use gradient backgrounds for buttons, improve container shadows, add transitions, match font and color scheme from style.css.
- Keep responsive design intact.
- Database: datasiswa, table admin (id, username, password), existing user 'tes' with hashed password.
